  **Background:** Mental health disorders are prevalent comorbidities affecting
  nearly two billion people worldwide. People with chronic diseases are at a
  higher risk of having mental health issues, which in turn potentially worsen
  their overall well-being.  
  
  **Objectives:**  Evaluate the interrelatedness of mental health problems with
  other diagnoses, reflected as a relative importance score of psychopharmaca
  in a medication claim registry.  
  
  **Methods:** Exploratory time-series analysis was performed using the
  University of Groningen prescription database, IADB.nl. A static cohort with
  at least one prescription of psychopharmaca from 2018 to 2022 was extracted.
  The prescription was evaluated daily using anatomical therapeutic chemical
  (ATC) classification, where psychopharmaca was evaluated at ATC level 3,
  drugs for the nervous system at ATC level 2, and other medications at ATC
  level 1, distinguished into a total of 24 medication classes. A
  medication-claim network was constructed as an undirected graph to capture
  dose-adjusted co-prescription. Eigenvector centrality ($c_e$) was computed as
  a measure of relative nodal importance, which reflects the degree of
  medication concurrence in a network. The number of medication claims ($n_c$),
  number of patients, claim-to-patient ratio, and eigenvector centrality were
  extracted as weekly-aggregated time-series data. Singular spectrum analysis
  was performed to decompose the data into its constituting trend, periodicity,
  and white noises.  
  
  **Results:** Antidepressants (ATC `N06A`, $c_e$: 0.11, $n_c$: 28,993),
  antipsychotics (`N05A`, $c_e$: 0.07, $n_c$: 14,027), and anxiolytics (`N05B`,
  $c_e$: 0.08, $n_c$: 14,061) are psychopharmaca with high eigenvector
  centrality. These classes of medication are likely to be co-prescribed
  alongside other medications. Further groups with high eigenvector centrality
  were medications for alimentary and metabolism (`A01-A16`, $c_e$: 0.15, $n_c$:
  53,602), blood (`B01-B06`, $c_e$: 0.06, $n_c$: 13,310), cardiovascular
  (`C01-C10`, $c_e$: 0.14, $n_c$: 44,802), analgesics (`N02`, $c_e$: 0.09, $n_c$:
  13,847), and respiratory (`R01-R07`, $c_e$: 0.09, $n_c$: 25,034). Among eight
  medications with high eigenvector centrality, only antidepressants had a
  positive time trend for both eigenvector centrality and actual number of
  claims.  
  
  **Discussion:** Eight medications, three of which are psychopharmaca, have a
  high eigenvector centrality, implying its concurrence on a population level.
  Positive time trends in both eigenvector centrality and claims suggest that
  increasing uses of antidepressants are related to co-prescription with other
  medication classes. Constructing a medication claim network enriches the
  exploratory analysis of medication use at the population level.
