**Background:** Mental health disorders are prevalent comorbidities
affecting nearly two billion people worldwide. People with chronic
diseases are at a higher risk of having mental health issues, which in
turn potentially worsen their overall well-being.

**Objectives:**  
Evaluate the interrelatedness of mental health problems with other
diagnoses, reflected as a relative importance score of psychopharmaca in
a medication claim registry.

**Methods:** Exploratory time-series analysis was performed using the
University of Groningen prescription database, IADB.nl. A closed cohort
with at least one prescription of anxiolytics/antidepressants from 2018
to 2022 was extracted. The prescription was evaluated daily using
anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification, where
psychopharmaca was evaluated at ATC level 4, drugs for the nervous
system at ATC level 3, and other medications at ATC level 1, leading to
a total of 24 medication classes. A drug prescription network was
constructed as an undirected graph to capture dose-adjusted
co-prescription. Eigenvector centrality ($c_e$) was computed as a
measure of relative nodal importance, which reflects the degree of
medication concurrence in a network. The number of medication claims
($n_c$), number of patients, claim-to-patient ratio, and eigenvector
centrality were extracted as weekly-aggregated time-series data.
Singular spectrum analysis was performed to decompose the data into its
constituting trend, periodicity, and white noises.

**Results:** Antidepressants (ATC `N06A`, $c_e$: 0.09, $n_c$: 28,993)
and anxiolytics (`N05B`, $c_e$: 0.04, $n_c$: 14,061) are psychopharmaca
with high eigenvector centrality. These classes of medication are likely
to be co-prescribed alongside other medications. Further groups with
high eigenvector centrality were medications for alimentary and
metabolism (`A01-A16`, $c_e$: 0.21, $n_c$: 53,602), blood (`B01-B06`,
$c_e$: 0.08, $n_c$: 13,310), cardiovascular (`C01-C10`, $c_e$: 0.19,
$n_c$: 44,802), analgesics (`N02`, $c_e$: 0.05, $n_c$: 13,847), and
respiratory (`R01-R07`, $c_e$: 0.09, $n_c$: 25,034). Among the seven
medication groups with high eigenvector centrality, only antidepressants
showed a positive time trend for both eigenvector centrality and actual
number of claims.

**Discussion:** Seven medications, three of which are psychopharmaca,
had a high eigenvector centrality, indicating concurrence with other
medication groups on a population level. Positive time trends in both
eigenvector centrality and claims suggest that increasing uses of
antidepressants was related to co-prescription with other medication
classes. Constructing a medication claim network enriches the
exploratory analysis of medication use at the population level.
