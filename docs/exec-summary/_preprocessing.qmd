### Data pre-processing
:::

Daily medication claims is a tabular data containing values from single medication entity for each patients in the cohort. Data transformation was performed to construct a square matrix of aggregate medication claim per day, with rows and columns representing groups of medication. Each element in the upper and lower triangle represents co-prescriptions, while the diagonal of the matrix represents single prescriptions. All elements in the matrix is a tally of drug combination/single prescription in a population level claimed on a daily basis. The matrix follows a knowledge graph construct with a subject-predicate-object (s, p, o) triples, i.e. `Medication1-PrescribedAlongside-Medication2`. The knowledge graph is a representation of medication-claim network, where the edge (predicate) is the number of concurrency. Weight was applied on the edges by dividing it by the defined daily dose (DDD). Weighting is necessary to regularize the matrix into a unit-free scale, which allow a direct comparison of one drug to another.
