### Data pre-processing
:::

Daily medication claims is a tabular data containing values from single medication entity for each patients in the cohort. Data transformation was performed to construct a square matrix of aggregate medication claim per day, with rows and columns representing groups of medication. Each element in the upper and lower triangle represents co-prescriptions, while the diagonal of the matrix represents single prescriptions. All elements in the matrix is a tally of drug combination/single prescription in a population level claimed on a daily basis. The matrix follows a knowledge graph construct with a subject-predicate-object (s, p, o) triples, i.e. `Medication1-PrescribedAlongside-Medication2`. The knowledge graph is a representation of drug prescription network (DPN), where the edge (predicate) is the number of concurrency. In the original DPN, the edge weight was the number of claims by assuming that all of defined daily doses (DDD) were equal to 1 [@Cavallo2012]. To account for augmentation polypharmacy, DDD provides further information due to the presence of a sub-dose medication, where DDD < 1 should be allowed. Naturally, an augmentation polypharmacy regimen should have a higher weight since this regimen is intended to increase the efficacy of the augmented medication [@Shrivastava2013]. Therefore, weight was re-applied on the edges by dividing the number of claims by the DDD.
