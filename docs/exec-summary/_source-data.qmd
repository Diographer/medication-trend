The University of Groningen IADB.nl pharmacy prescription database is a growing database that contains prescription data for 31 years from 1994 till 2024 from approximately 120 community pharmacies and covers an estimated population of 1,120,000 patients. Registration in the database is irrespective of health care insurance and age, gender and prescription rates among the database population have been found to be representative of the Netherlands as a whole, and the database has been widely used for research. Each person is individually tracked throughout the database period and prescription records contain information on the date of dispensing, the quantity dispensed, the dose regimen, the number of days the prescription is valid, the prescribing physician and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code (ATC code). Each patient has a unique anonymous identifier; date of birth and gender are known. Due to the high patient-pharmacy commitment in the Netherlands, the medication records for each patient are virtually complete, except for over the counter (OTC) drugs and medication dispensed during hospitalization. This analysis include daily medication claims from a static cohort of adults aged 18-65 years old and prescribed for anxiolytics or antidepressants at least once in the time span from 2018 to 2022.
